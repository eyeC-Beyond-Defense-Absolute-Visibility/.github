# 👁️ eyeC(ybersecurity) — Beyond Defense, Absolute Visibility

> "In the kernel we trust, in the noise we find truth."

Welcome to the **eyeC** organization. We specialize in high-fidelity security engineering, focusing on kernel-level enforcement, eBPF-based observability, and rigorous adversary simulation. Our mission is to move past traditional "black box" security toward a model of **Absolute Visibility**.

## 🛡️ The Ecosystem: Shield & Storm

We believe defense cannot be validated without a sophisticated offense. Our work is split into two specialized pillars that feed into each other through a continuous **Purple Team loop**.

### 🌊 MAELSTROM-BREACH
**Adversary Simulation Framework**

- **Purpose:** Offensive stress-testing of modern security stacks.
- **Capabilities:** Distributed SYN pressure, L7 method hijacking, and DNS exfiltration.
- **Focus:** Validating detection fidelity and enforcement resilience under sustained chaos.

### 🛡️ SOVEREIGN-SHIELD
**eBPF-Powered Defensive Architecture**

- **Purpose:** Real-time kernel enforcement and zero-trust micro-segmentation.
- **Capabilities:** Syscall tracing, L7 protocol inspection, and automated Ansible-driven quarantine.
- **Focus:** High-performance security that scales without degrading system stability.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: The Purple Loop

1. **Simulate:** Execute distributed attacks via Maelstrom.
2. **Observe:** Capture telemetry using Sentinel Trace (eBPF).
3. **Enforce:** Apply granular kernel hooks via Cilium.
4. **Automate:** Trigger Ansible playbooks for sub-3s incident response.
5. **Refine:** Use performance metrics to harden the security policy.
